## THIS DOCUMENT WILL START WITH A 02_DAT_CLEAN file

Here we augment the clean merged data file.

For income data, we replace the "NA"s with a catogory called "No income data available", then we make the variable a factor based on income, ranking "high income" highest, and "No income data available" lowest.

```{r}
### we need to check that the data name is correct, and start with a 02_DAT_CLEAN file
outbreaks_wdi <- outbreaks_wdi |> 
  mutate(Income.Group = ifelse(is.na(Income.Group), 
                               "No income data available", 
                               Income.Group),
         Income.Group = (factor(Income.Group, levels = c("High income",
                                                         "Upper middle income", 
                                                         "Lower middle income", 
                                                         "Low income", 
                                                         "No income data available"))))

```

### THIS DOCUMENT WILL END WITH A 03_DAT_AUG file, that we all use for the graphs.
