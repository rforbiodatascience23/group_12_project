## Cleaning data process

This file contains all the steps we followed to clean the data and create a suitable dataset for our study analysis.

**Cleaning of the unique DONs and Covid-19 outbreak datasets**

```{r}
unique_dons_clean <- unique_dons |>
  rename(Index = X) |>
  mutate(Definition = if_else(Definition == "", "Unspecified", Definition)) |> 
  mutate(icd11l2 = if_else(icd11l2 == "", "Not reported", icd11l2)) |>
  mutate(icd11l3 = if_else(icd11l3 == "", "Not reported", icd11l3))
  
covid_outbreaks_clean <- covid_outbreaks |>
  rename(Index = X) |>
  mutate(icd11c1 = as.character(icd11c1))
```
