## CLEAN WDI DATA: 
We keep only the variables needed, and rename Country.Code to iso3 for merging purposes. We filter to include only countries with income data available. 
```{r}
wdi_clean <- wdi |> 
  select(Country.Code, Income.Group) |> 
  rename(iso3 = Country.Code) |> 
  filter(Income.Group !="")

```



## MERGING DATA: 

```{r}
#### WHEN WE ARE READY WE CAN MERGE THE WDI CLEAN TO the "outbreak data"
outbreaks_wdi <-  
  left_join(outbreaks, wdi_clean, by = "iso3")

```
