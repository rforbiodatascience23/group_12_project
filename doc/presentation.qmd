## Introduction {.smaller}

. . .

Disease outbreaks are caused when infectious diseases spread rapidly across the world and they can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.

. . .

**Infectious outbreaks cause severe health treats globally such as:**

::: incremental
-   COVID-19 2019-2022 (affected 562 million people worldwide)

-   SARS-CoV in 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome

-   Influenza A (H1N1) in 2009-2010

. . .

**Environmental factors can influence the disease transmission, these include socioencomic factors as well as region and geographic factors.**

 - **Their aim** was to create a new dataset of infectious disease outbreaks from the Disease Outbreak News and Coronavirus Dashboard (WHO)

. . .

**Our aim** was to :

-   Reproduce their findings
-   Add other factors such as socioeconmic data

## Materials and Methods

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Result 1

**Final dataset:**

```         
Merged by Alpha-3 Country-codes
    2227 (????) observations from 1996-2022
    233 (???) countries
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Result 2 {.smaller}

**Outbreaks over time**

-   Diseases with the most outbreaks: [COVID-19, Influenza virus, Cholera]{.fragment .highlight-red}

-   Frequency of zoonotic diseases has increased the last decade

We could include Mikolaj's figure next to this one.

## Discussion 1

-   The authors of the article adhere to **FAIR guidelines** for scientific data management

-   

    ```         
          Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability
    ```

-   

    ```         
          The use of standardised naming (ISO-3166 and ICD-10) makes it possible to merge the data with data from other resources. 
    ```

-   *Strengths and limitations:*

-   

    ```         
          Access and tidy data (using tidyverse princibles)
          Reproduce the plots provided in the article and add novel graphics
          Added new data on income status, providing further knowledge on outbreaks
    ```

-   

    ```         
          Did not include new DONs (webscraping) (No obtained permission, packages, time)
          Current income status - not per year
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion 2

**Important for the development of targeting strategies**

-   Geographical factors and socio-economic factors can influence the spread of the disease and the susceptibility of the population

    ```         
         -  Vaccine consideration before traveling to high-risk geographical regions
    ```

-   The data of the study does not reflect the intensity of the disease (cases, deaths)

    ```         
          - epidemiological data
    ```

-   Use for improvement of bio-surveillance: [detection and prevention of biological threats]{.fragment .highlight-green}
