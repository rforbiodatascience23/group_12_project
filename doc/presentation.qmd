## Introduction

Infectious diseases can spread rapidly across the world and can be caused by germs such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.

-   **Infectious outbreaks causes severe health treats globally**

-   

    ```         
      Ie. epidemics/pandemics such as 
          COVID-19 2019-2022 (affected 562 million people worldwide)
          SARS-CoV in 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome
          Influenza A (H1N1) in 2009-2010
    ```

-   **Environmental factors influence the disease transmission, including factors related to country income status**

-   

    ```         
      Ie. water supply, sanitation facilities, food, climate etc.
    ```

## Material and Methods

We found inspiration in this article

![https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01797-2](~/projects/group_12_project/_raw/artikelheader.PNG){width="250"}

-   **Their aim** was to create a new dataset of infectious disease outbreaks and geospatial information from

-   

    ```         
      Disease Outbreak News (WHO)
      Coronavirus Dashbord (WHO)
      Opendatasoft.com
    ```

-   **Our aim** was to

-   

    ```         
      Reproduce their findings
      Add socio-economical informations (from the World Bank)
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Materials and Methods

**Data sources**

-   

    ```         
    *DONs (raw):*
          2721 reports on confirmed acute public health events 1996 - 2022
    ```

-   

    ```         
    *Unique DONs:*
          1562 observations with unique outbreaks
          217 countries
          69 infectious diseases
    ```

-   

    ```         
    *Covid Outbreaks:*
          665 observations from 2020-2022
          224 countries
    ```

-   

    ```         
    *Geospatial data:*
          ? observations?
    ```

-   

    ```         
    *Country income data from the World Data Bank:*
          Income status per country (High, Upper Middle, Lower Middle, Low Income)
          217 countries
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Results 1

**Final dataset:**

-   

    ```         
    Merged by Alpha-3 Country-codes
        2227 (????) observations from 1996-2022
        233 (???) countries
    ```

-   PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE THE DATA FLOW CHART HERE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Result 2

**Outbreaks per country and map**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Result 3

**Outbreaks frequency and Income status**


![Fig. 4b Top 20 disease-outbreaks(Reproduced)](~/projects/group_12_project/Results/Fig4b_reproduced.png)
![Fig. 4b Top 20 disease-outbreaks colored by country income status (Novel)](~/projects/group_12_project/Results/Fig4b_income.png){width="250"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Result 4

**Outbreaks over time**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion 1

-   The authors of the article adhere to **FAIR guidelines** for scientific data management

-   

    ```         
          Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability
    ```

-   

    ```         
          The use of standardised naming (ISO-3166 and ICD-10) makes it possible to merge the data with data from other resources. 
    ```

-   *Strenght and limitation:*

-   

    ```         
          Access and tidy data (using tidyverse princibles)
          Reproduce the plots provided in the article and add novel graphics
          Added new data on income status, providing further knowledge on outbreaks
    ```

-   

    ```         
          Did not include new DONs (webscraping)
              1. No obtained permission 
              2. Require packages and time not feasible for this assignment
    ```
